October was a special time. Honoured to play along side one of Australia's best techno DJ's and dear friend Fuzion for a Mareena hosted new faces night at Tresor

[New Faces Live at Tresor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1009223 "New Faces Live at Tresor")

This has been a massive highlight for my experince living techno for 20 years. To make it to Berlin for not one DJ set but also a live improvisational modular techno set was a significant experience that I will struggle to put into words.

Much love and respect to Tresor, our wonderful host Mareena, who really sets a high and infectious standard and all that shared the evening with us.
